# Galaxia
Galaxia is a mod for minecraft 1.7.10 that adds complex rocketry, 
realistic interplanetary travel, planet surfaces, and more. Designed for GTNH.

This is kind of a developer backend for me testing things before I push it to GTNH's copy of our mod.
If the mod is in a usable state when you see this message, please do not build or download it from here.
This repo is not designed for players or beta testers, solely for developers to use as a testing ground for hazardous changes.
Downloading anything from here is sure to cause problems, I can nearly guarentee it. If something works, it will most likely be in GTNH's repo.


As of Februrary 8th 2026, there is no timeline for release. Check with GTNH's repo for the mod to see more up to date stuff on how we're doing, or check the design doc.
